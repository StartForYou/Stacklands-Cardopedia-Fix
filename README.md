# Stacklands Cardopedia Fix

This is a simple Stacklands mod for learning.

This mod aims to fix the issue of cardopedia entries being disordered due to improper card attributes in some other mods

I have noticed that occasionally, adding new creature type cards to the game can cause the card list to become disorganized. Perhaps due to updates to the game version, I have found that some mods involving creature type cards in the Steam Workshop also exist this bug
